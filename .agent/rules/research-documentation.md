Create a "research.md" file in the /docs directory. When asked to research something, or gather information make sure to add this information into the research.md file verbatim in a detailed, well structured and exhaustive manner. If we discover that some information was wrong make sure to update the research.md file with the corrected information.

Maintain and keep the research.md file updated.

NEVER overwite the previous research, always append the file with new findings.
