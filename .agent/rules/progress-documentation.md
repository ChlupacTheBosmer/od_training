Create a "progress.md" file in the /docs directory. Update this file with a summary from the implementation of each phase and task based on the "plan.md" file. This file should contain all the history of what we dealt with, what we developed and implemented and why. This file will track progress of tackling individual tasks and phases in the plan.md and will ensure that all agents have full reference even after exhausting their context window.
